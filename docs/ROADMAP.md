# Roadmap

## Vision
To become the default tool for "unsticking" creative blocks and organizing mental chaos, bridging the gap between a messy mind and a structured project management tool.

## Current Phase: Beta 2.0
✅ Core 5-Agent Pipeline
✅ Immersive Theatrical UI
✅ Basic Refinement Chat
✅ Gamification (Scores/Badges)

## Short-Term Goals (1-3 Months)
- [ ] **Voice Integration**: Use Gemini Live API to allow users to "rant" verbally instead of typing. 🚧 *In Progress*
- [ ] **Export Options**: Add "Copy to Markdown" and "Save as PDF" buttons.
- [ ] **Mobile Optimization**: Refine the `ProcessingTheater` layout for smaller screens.

## Medium-Term Goals (3-6 Months)
- [ ] **User Accounts**: Firebase/Supabase integration to save history.
- [ ] **Direct Integrations**: OAuth connections to create Notion pages or Trello cards directly from the Result screen.
- [ ] **Custom Personas**: Allow users to tweak Agent personalities (e.g., "Make Sparky more aggressive").

## Long-Term Vision (6+ Months)
- [ ] **Multi-Modal Input**: Upload images/screenshots of messy notes for Listie to decode.
- [ ] **Team Mode**: Collaborative brainstorming sessions where agents mediate between multiple users.
